*** Make sure you have an AWS Account and AWS cli installed on your local machine. all of this was done usng VSCODE
    and the terminal. Make sure you already un the aws configuration to connect to your AWS account. ***
*** Make sure you have Docker downloaded to your local machine ***

*** the "#" represesnts where on the command you will have to input your custom information ***

*** this is howmyou run a docker container using a file to customize your webpage. i chose to use an html file which i got from
    the documentation at https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-use-the-official-nginx-docker-image/ and customized it. This is also a good way
    to check to see if your image works. ***
docker run -it --rm -d -p 8080:80 --name #name# -v ~/site-content:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx

*** before running the command below i made sure to create a Dockerfile to automate the spin up of my docker image and container. ***
docker build -t webserver .

*** The code below gives us the deployment time of our continater and than appends the output the index file that we created. ***
docker inspect -f '{{.State.StartedAt}}' #container name# >> index.html

*** now we run the container from the custom image ***
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name #web# #image name#

*** Next up is getting your AWS information using the command below ***
aws sts get-caller-identification

*** now to authenticate docker. Note that they are only valid for 12 hours ***
aws ecr get-login-password --region #region# | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin #asw_account_id#.dkr.ecr.#region#.amazonaws.com

*** create a repository ***
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name #name#

*** tag our image to the repository ***
docker tag #image id# #aws_account_id#.dkr.ecr.#region#.amazonaws.com/#my-repository#:tag

*** push our image up to AWS ECR ***
docker push #aws_account_id#.dkr.ecr.#region#.amazonaws.com/#my-repository#:tag

*** And that should do it. double check your AWS console to see the Docker container that we created and pushed to AWS ECR ***
